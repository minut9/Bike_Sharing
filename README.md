## Purpose
This analysis dives deeper into NYC Citibike data for prospective Des Moines to begin a Citibike program

### Analysis
It is important to keep in mind that NYC has been established before Des Moines and the population in Manhattan is far greater than this prospective expansion project. The Data in NYC in August (A peak time for optimal weather), the data found that most people who were subscribers to the program were male and peak times were during morning rush hour of 8 O'clock and evening rush hour of 5 O'clock.

This photo above shows the categories of men, women, and unknown and it is clear that males are the dominent subscriber for this program. Both photos (above and below) show clear peak times in deep red which are to and from work.

#### Time spent
 It is very apparent, accoriding to the data, that out of the 2.3 million people who use the bike program, there are roughly 3x more use from males than females, and it is also clear that those who use the prgram, do not spend more than an hour or so with the product (a bike).

And for assessing time, there is a perfect time between, 1am and 5am to do repairs when necessary on equipment. An analysis such as this for Des Moines will need to be done.

NYC is majority subscribers than customers. It is vital to look into tourism, avg income, folks with cars in the city, active adults in Des Moines to maybe get a better understanding of the demographic in this city.

## Summary 
The duration of the bike use was quite minimal; of course a few outliers exist, but turn over of bikes are around an hour. So in a city of intense population, NYC actually has room for marketing and growth for customers, not to be confused with subscribers. For Des Moines, if there is the right marketing and advertisment, there could be high potential for customers to rent bikes to increase rental duration and increase tourism revenue across the city. Of course staking a position in subscribers is important, Des Moines is not NYC and the demographic in how you approach this market is different and important to note. Because NYC has such a high density of residents who live in the city, it is easier to market to this population as their commute to jobs and leisure activities are in a bike rides distance.
In NYC the most useage of Bikes happens in high toursim areas, according to the map below, it would be vital to gather more information for the traffic of the population in the city for an assessment such as this map.
